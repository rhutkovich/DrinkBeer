# DrinkBeer
Drink Beer originally written by @Lekavar, updated and slightly customized by @ClockwerkKaiser and finally patched by @rhutkovich.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Mod stability is not guaranteed (yet) ‚ö†Ô∏è

Current state seems to be working for setup:
```Minecraft 1.20.1```, ```Fabric Loader 0.15.6```, ```Fabric 0.91.1+1.20.1```

### ‚úÖ What works:
- Main items crafts (Keg, Mugs, bells, etc.) from: [original mod page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/drink-beer-forge)
- Brewing beer process
- Beer drinking post-effects

### ‚ùå What doesn't work:
- There is no separate tab in Creative Mode, thus items are not available in Creative UI.
- There is no crafts/recipes suggestion in mods like Just Enough Items.

### üóíÔ∏è Notes:
- While items are not directly available in Creative Mode in UI, they are still obtainable using `/give` command.
- To create a __Call Bell__ you have to exactly use __Dark Oak Planks__:

Special thanks to Lekavar for initial creating this amazing mod and ClockwerKaiser for maintaining it!
